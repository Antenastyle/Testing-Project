> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- It was very helpful to learn how to test software in the practical way. The good point was that the Webapp is a big one and it doesn't have any apparent errors in it.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I toke one by one the test cases and started testing all the positive tests and seeing no errors and the tests passing, then I continued with the negative tests, trying to get all possible errors the Webapp should throw in every input field and selectable.
- Also tried repeating the names of the projects, issues and all the tested areas to see the reaction of the Webapp and to note it in the test cases.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
-  I personally recommend Jira as an issue and project tracking tool, Jira offers robust capabilities for test case management through its Jira Software module too. It allows teams to create, track, and manage test cases, test plans, and test execution within the Jira environment.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code with the Auto-Open Markdown Preview extension to see the final result of the markdown files.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I found no trouble during this project


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I have used GitHub before in numerous ocassions so I found no trouble using it. In my home institution we use it to manage all the version control of our projects and I use it in all my personal projects so I already have quite big experience with the use of it.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- In the past I used Java to create test cases for an application and it went smooth so I think in the future I will keep using Java to develop the test cases of any application because Java is very versatile and can make the tests as verbose as the developper wants.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Java, Cucumber, Selenium, Quality Assurance, Software Testing



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Test Case Design, Test Automation, Java, API Testing, Test Management Tools, Analytical Thinkig, Communication Skills, Adaptability, Stakeholder Management, Customer Focus




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I think that when I started this course I already had a big base and experience in software testing. I did some 'competitions' of software testing and participated in some code katas where the software testing was the most important skill.
- Regarding to the project, it was helpful and fun, because we can put the theoretical base we learned during the course to the practic side, also this course helped me to develop the analytic thinking skill.
